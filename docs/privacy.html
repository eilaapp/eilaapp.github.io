    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Fees and Taxes:</b> You are responsible for data and mobile carrier fees and taxes associated

    <p class=MsoNormal>You should be aware that there are certain things that We as the service Provider will not take
      responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
      connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but We cannot take responsibility for the
      app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
      allowance left.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
      agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
      provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
      accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
      charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
      without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app,
      please be aware that we assume that you have

    <h4>Data Backup</h4>
    <p class=MsoNormal>It is your responsibility to enable local(on device) and cloud data backups, so that you will be
      able to restore data when you reinstall EILA. We do not send your data to our servers nor we store it on our
      servers, hence you should always enable backup to avoid losing data. This will, to some extent, make sure you have
      a backup when you reinstall EILA or lose your phone. We do not warrant that backup will always be successful, due
      to internet or other technical issues, hence you should monitor it from time to time. You can also copy backup
      files generated on your device as a precaution. Note that if you install the App on multiple devices and use the
      same cloud backup account, all backups will end up in the same cloud storage, hence when you restore, with the
      latest EILA version, you have the option to choose the backup to restore, it is your responsibility to choose the
      correct restore file, in the latest EILA version at least 3 backup histories are stored. <b>When you uninstall the App, 
      depending on your OS version the OS might also delete on device backup files, hence make sure to save the backup 
      before uninstalling, however if you have enabled cloud/Google backups, cloud backups are not deleted when App is uninstalled.</b>
      EILA backup directory typical path is <b>Android ➔ data ➔ com.burusho.eila ➔ files ➔ Eila ➔ backup</b>. Note that the 
      path might be different on your device based on the OS.</p>

    <h4>Backup Data Deletion</h4>
    <p class=MsoNormal>You can delete both on device and cloud backup files if you choose so. To delete on device files,
      use any file browser on your device, go to eila backup directory by following this path <b>Android ➔
      data ➔ com.burusho.eila ➔ files ➔ Eila ➔ backup</b> and delete the files, note that the path might be different on 
      your device based on the OS. If you have enabled Google Drive backups, you can delete these backups by logging in to 
      Google drive, go to <b>Settings ➔ Manage Apps ➔ Eila ➔ Options ➔ Delete hidden app data</b>
    </p>

    <h4>Data Restore</h4>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Restore is the functionality of restoring data from a previous backup. <b>Before
      restoring data from backup, system will permanently remove all existing data on the device, which cannot be
      undone</b>. In older versions of EILA only the latest backup was stored at any given time and old backups were 
      deleted, hence as a precaution after restore is completed auto backups were disabled to prevent immediate backups
      right after restore, which could overwrite previous backup, hence it is recommended to test the restored data and enable
      auto backups if you are satisfied with the restored data, this is to make sure you don’t lose previous backup due
      to any new backups. However in the latest EILA version at least 3 backup histories are stored, and backup is 
      no more auto disabled after restore.</p>
